Dear Faculty Members,

Over the last decade, Learning Management Systems (LMS) have become mainstream in higher education and are widely used across many Universities. As you are aware, Amity has launched the Learning Management System (A-LMS) to support teaching and learning initiatives for a better interface & flow of Learning Materials to the students during the month of December 2016. From Feb 2018, the LMS was merged with Amizone.  So, it is expected from all faculty members to use the LMS features in a more effective way and encourage student participation. All institutions & faculty & students did use the A-LMS. But we need to increase the utilization of A-LMS among faculty and the students, it has thus been discussed & recommended that all internal assessment components will be routed through the A-LMS (both online & offline assessment activities).

 Some of the important features of A-LMS for your ready reference: -

Recorded Video Lectures with Quizzes – It is a pedagogical approach in which direct instruction moves from the group learning space to the individual learning space. A short video lecture/Open source reference material covering the conceptual background of subjects created/shared by the faculty are viewed by the students before the class session and the class time is devoted towards case study, exercises, projects and discussions.
Posting Content or Uploading Files – Faculty members can upload all the course related textual content such as Syllabus, Presentations, Files, Images, URLs, Videos, Scorm etc. at A-LMS, which student can access from any part of the world using Internet at any time.
Assessments - The Assignment option allows instructors to create coursework and assign it a name, point value, and description, attach files, manage grades for each student and can easily track their performance.
Announcements - Announcements tool can be used to provide students with course reminders and updates. Announcements can contain text, images, and multimedia, as well as it can be linked to course content, Assignments & Tests.
Grade Center - The Grade Center is a built-in grade book for each course in A-LMS. It provides a place to store, manage, and calculate student grades, both on items such as assignments and tests that are created and graded within A-LMS as well as on items that are created outside the A-LMS, which can be entered manually into the grade center.
Discussion Board – A-LMS discussion board feature allows participants to carry on discussions online, at any time of the day or night, with no need for the participants to be logged into the site at the same time. The discussions may be graded as well.  Faculty can add multiple discussion board forums in their course.
